ContactApp
==========

Simple Contacts List App

Clearly this is no where near (in my opinion) a complete app but it's a start. There are plenty of things 
to improve on in this project (given that I'm no pro) that I hope to accomplish. But first I want to go over
some basic features I was able to make work.

Some Basic Features:
--Load list of available contacts into the listView widget
---contact name, phone number
---photo loads in second view (once a contact is clicked on list)
--implimented a 3D listview


Over time, as it allows, I plan to add new features to this.

such as:
--Dial button to call the contact
--Text button to text the contact
--email link (if available)
--google+ link (if available)
--UI redesign (for better flow of information)
