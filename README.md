ContactApp
==========

Simple Contacts List App

Clearly this is no where near (in my opinion) a complete app but it's a start. There are plenty of things 
to improve on in this project (given that I'm no pro) that I hope to accomplish. But first I want to go over
some basic features I was able to make work.

Some Basic Features:<br />
--Load list of available contacts into the listView widget<br />
---Contact name, phone number<br />
---Photo loads in second view (once a contact is clicked on list)<br />
--Implimented a 3D listview<br />
--List filter

<img src="/view1.png" /><br />
Over time, as it allows, I plan to add new features to this.

such as:<br />
--Create a custom ArrayAdapter<br />
--Dial button to call the contact<br />
--Text button to text the contact<br />
--Email link (if available)<br />
--Google+ link (if available)<br />
--UI redesign (for better flow of information)<br />
--Editing contacts
