ContactApp (Simple) 
==========

Clearly this is no where near (in my opinion) a complete app but it's a start. There are plenty of things 
to improve on in this project (given that I'm no pro) that I hope to accomplish. But first I want to go over
some basic features I was able to make work.

<h2>Some Basic Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Load list of available contacts into the listView widget</li>
<li>Contact name, phone number</li></li>
<li>Photo loads in second view (once a contact is clicked on list)</li>
<li>Implimented a 3D listview</li>
<li>List filter</li>
</ul>

<img src="/view2.png" width="50%" />
<img src="/view1.png" width="50%" /><br />
Over time, as it allows, I plan to add new features to this.

<h2>Future Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a custom ArrayAdapter</li>
<li>Dial button to call the contact</li>
<li>Text button to text the contact</li>
<li>Email link (if available)</li>
<li>Google+ link (if available)</li>
<li>UI redesign (for better flow of information)</li>
<li>Editing contacts</li>
</ul>
